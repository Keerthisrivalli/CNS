Firewall Traffic Simulation
This project simulates network traffic and applies predefined firewall rules to determine whether incoming traffic should be allowed or blocked. It serves as a simple demonstration of how firewall rules can be implemented and how traffic flows can be controlled based on IP addresses and port numbers.

Features:
Simulates network traffic by randomly generating IP addresses and port numbers.
Applies firewall rules to decide whether the traffic should be allowed or blocked.
Provides the option to control how long or how many iterations the simulation runs.
Demonstrates how firewall rules can be defined and checked for both IP addresses and ports.
Use Case:
This project can be used for:

Testing: Simulate network traffic in a controlled environment.
Learning: Understand how firewalls work and how to apply simple rules to control traffic.
Networking Simulation: Create a basic simulation of network traffic to visualize how a firewall handles different requests.
Customization:
The firewall rules are customizable; you can define which IP addresses and ports are allowed or blocked.
You can modify the duration of the simulation or the number of traffic checks.
Dependencies:
Python 3.x
No additional libraries required (built-in libraries only).
